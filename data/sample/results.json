The program aired on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network from 1967–1969 in the 9:30&nbsp;p.m. night time slot. During the second season, ''N.Y.P.D'' was joined by ''[[The Mod Squad]]'' and ''[[It Takes a Thief (1968 TV series)|It Takes a Thief]]'' to form a 2½ hour block of crime dramas.\n\n==Plot==\n''N.Y.P.D.'' centers around three New York police detectives – Lieutenant Mike Haines ([[Jack Warden]]), Detective Jeff Ward ([[Robert Hooks]]), and Detective Johnny Corso ([[Frank Converse]]) – who fight a wide range of crimes and criminals. The show features many real New York City locations, as well as episodes based on actual New York City police cases.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jack Warden]] as Lt. Mike Haines\n* [[Robert Hooks]] as Det. Jeff Ward\n* [[Frank Converse]] as Det. Johnny Corso\n* [[Ted Beniades]] as Det. Richie\n* [[Denise Nicholas]] as Ethel\n* [[Tom Rosqui]] as Det. Jacobs\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nThe show was produced by [[Talent Associates]], Ltd., a company founded by Alfred Levy and [[David Susskind]]. Talent Associates had produced 14 years of the anthology program ''[[Armstrong Circle Theatre]]'' and ''[[The Kaiser Aluminum Hour]]''. David Susskind created ''N.Y.P.D.'' with screenwriter [[Arnold Perl]] (''[[Cotton Comes to Harlem]]''). [[Daniel Melnick]], executive producer of ''N.Y.P.D.'', was a partner with Susskind in Talent Associates and had brought [[Mel Brooks]] and [[Buck Henry]] together to create the television comedy ''[[Get Smart]]'' in 1965. Producer Susskind and actor [[Harvey Keitel]] would work together again on [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'' (1974). One of the writers on the series was [[Lonne Elder]], who would later become the first African-American nominated for a Best Screenplay Oscar (for the 1972 movie ''[[Sounder (film)|Sounder]]'').\n\n===Casting===\nAmong the guest stars who appeared in the series were: \n* [[Al Pacino]] (S02E05; \"Deadly Circle of Violence\")\n* [[Martin Sheen]] (S02E08 \"The Peep Freak\")\n* [[Jon Voight]] (S01E14; \"The Bombers\")\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] (S02E06; \"The Shady Lady\")\n* [[Jane Alexander]] (S02E14; \"The Night Watch\")\n* [[Roy Scheider]] (S02E19; \"Who's Got the Bundle?\")\n* [[Sam Waterston]] (S02E23; \"No Day Trippers Need Apply\")\n* [[Charles Grodin]] (S01E06; \"Money Man\")\n* [[Howard Da Silva]] (S01E07; \"Old Gangsters Never Die\")\n* [[Murray Hamilton]] (S01E24; \"The Private Eye Puzzle\")\n* [[Charles Durning]] (S02E01 \"Naked in the Streets\")\nOthers include: [[Robert Alda]], [[Rutanya Alda]], [[Conrad Bain]], [[Philip Bosco]], [[John Cazale]], [[Leslie Charleson]], [[Miriam Colon]], [[Franklin Cover]], [[Matthew Cowles]], [[Blythe Danner]], [[Ossie Davis]], [[Mary Fickett]], [[Scott Glenn]], [[Moses Gunn]], [[Graham Jarvis]], [[James Earl Jones]], [[Raul Julia]], [[Marcia Jean Kurtz]], [[Laurence Luckinbill]], [[Nancy Marchand]], [[Bill Macy]], [[Donna McKechnie]], [[Meg Myles]], [[Priscilla Pointer]], [[Andrew Robinson (actor)|Andrew Robinson]], [[Esther Rolle]], [[Richard Ward (actor)|Richard Ward]], [[Louis Zorich]], [[Jill Clayburgh]], [[Jane Elliot]], [[Ralph Waite]], [[Gretchen Corbett]]\n\n===Writing===\nIn 1967, ''N.Y.P.D.'' was the first television series in America to air an episode with a self-identified gay character (\"Shakedown\").<ref>{{Cite web |date=2008-07-23 |title=The Museum presents “Not That There’s Anything Wrong with That”: The History of Gay and Lesbian Images on Television |url=https://www.paleycenter.org/press-releases/press-release-2004-gay-lesbian-television-history/ |access-date=2024-09-18 |website=Paley Center |language=en-US}}</ref>  The plot of the episode centers around the police tracking down a blackmailer who has triggered several suicides by their targeting of gay men.  In the course of their investigation, the police also visit a gay rights group, another first.\n\n''N.Y.P.D.'' scripts featured both black and white people as cops, suspects, and witnesses, an unselfconscious racial blend that would not otherwise be seen for several years on U.S. network television ([[Room 222|''Room 222'']] and [[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|''Hawaii Five-O'']] were among the next series to feature casts situated similarly.)\n\n===Opening credits===\nThe series' opening credit sequence, prominently featuring a closeup of a police car emergency light as the vehicle drives through the streets of New York, would later be spoofed in the 1980s comedy series ''[[Police Squad!]]'' and subsequent movies.\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Season 1 (1967–68)===\n{{Episode

    "text": "N.Y.P.D. is a half-hour long American police crime drama set in the context of the New York City Police Department. The program aired on the ABC network from 1967–1969 in the 9:30 p.m. night time slot. During the second season, N.Y.P.D was joined by The Mod Squad and It Takes a Thief to form a 2½ hour block of crime dramas. N.Y.P.D. centers around three New York police detectives – Lieutenant Mike Haines (Jack Warden), Detective Jeff Ward (Robert Hooks), and Detective Johnny Corso (Frank Converse) – who fight a wide range of crimes and criminals. The show features many real New York City locations, as well as episodes based on actual New York City police cases. Jack Warden as Lt. Mike Haines Robert Hooks as Det. Jeff Ward Frank Converse as Det. Johnny Corso Ted Beniades as Det. Richie Denise Nicholas as Ethel Tom Rosqui as Det. Jacobs The show was produced by Talent Associates, Ltd., a company founded by Alfred Levy and David Susskind. Talent Associates had produced 14 years of the anthology program Armstrong Circle Theatre and The Kaiser Aluminum Hour. David Susskind created N.Y.P.D. with screenwriter Arnold Perl (Cotton Comes to Harlem). Daniel Melnick, executive producer of N.Y.P.D., was a partner with Susskind in Talent Associates and had brought Mel Brooks and Buck Henry together to create the television comedy Get Smart in 1965. Producer Susskind and actor Harvey Keitel would work together again on Martin Scorsese's Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore (1974). One of the writers on the series was Lonne Elder, who would later become the first African-American nominated for a Best Screenplay Oscar (for the 1972 movie Sounder). Among the guest stars who appeared in the series were: Al Pacino (S02E05; \"Deadly Circle of Violence\") Martin Sheen (S02E08 \"The Peep Freak\") Jon Voight (S01E14; \"The Bombers\") Harvey Keitel (S02E06; \"The Shady Lady\") Jane Alexander (S02E14; \"The Night Watch\") Roy Scheider (S02E19; \"Who's Got the Bundle?\") Sam Waterston (S02E23; \"No Day Trippers Need Apply\") Charles Grodin (S01E06; \"Money Man\") Howard Da Silva (S01E07; \"Old Gangsters Never Die\") Murray Hamilton (S01E24; \"The Private Eye Puzzle\") Charles Durning (S02E01 \"Naked in the Streets\") Others include: Robert Alda, Rutanya Alda, Conrad Bain, Philip Bosco, John Cazale, Leslie Charleson, Miriam Colon, Franklin Cover, Matthew Cowles, Blythe Danner, Ossie Davis, Mary Fickett, Scott Glenn, Moses Gunn, Graham Jarvis, James Earl Jones, Raul Julia, Marcia Jean Kurtz, Laurence Luckinbill, Nancy Marchand, Bill Macy, Donna McKechnie, Meg Myles, Priscilla Pointer, Andrew Robinson, Esther Rolle, Richard Ward, Louis Zorich, Jill Clayburgh, Jane Elliot, Ralph Waite, Gretchen Corbett In 1967, N.Y.P.D. was the first television series in America to air an episode with a self-identified gay character (\"Shakedown\"). The plot of the episode centers around the police tracking down a blackmailer who has triggered several suicides by their targeting of gay men. In the course of their investigation, the police also visit a gay rights group, another first. N.Y.P.D. scripts featured both black and white people as cops, suspects, and witnesses, an unselfconscious racial blend that would not otherwise be seen for several years on U.S. network television (Room 222 and Hawaii Five-O were among the next series to feature casts situated similarly.) The series' opening credit sequence, prominently featuring a closeup of a police car emergency light as the vehicle drives through the streets of New York, would later be spoofed in the 1980s comedy series Police Squad! and subsequent movies. \"The Museum presents \"Not That There's Anything Wrong with That\": The History of Gay and Lesbian Images on Television\".

    "opening_text": "Escape from Sobibor is a 1987 British television film which aired on ITV and CBS. It is the story of the mass escape from the Nazi extermination camp at Sobibor, the most successful uprising by Jewish prisoners of German extermination camps (uprisings also took place at Auschwitz-Birkenau and Treblinka). The film was directed by Jack Gold and shot in Avala, Yugoslavia (now Serbia). The full 176-minute version shown in the UK on 10 May 1987 was pre-empted by a 143-minute version shown in the United States on 12 April 1987. The script, by Reginald Rose, was based on Richard Rashke's 1983 book of the same name, along with a manuscript by Thomas Blatt, \"From the Ashes of Sobibor\", and a book by Stanisław Szmajzner, Inferno in Sobibor. Alan Arkin, Joanna Pacuła, and Rutger Hauer were the primary stars of the film. The film received a Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film and Hauer received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role—Television Film or Miniseries. Esther Raab was a camp survivor who had assisted Rashke with his book and served as a technical consultant.",

Of the 600 inmates in the camp, roughly 300 escaped, although all but 50–70 were later re-captured and killed.<ref>{{cite book|author=Schelvis, Jules|author-link=Jules Schelvis| title=Sobibor: A History of a Nazi Death Camp| publisher= Berg, Oxford & New Cork|year= 2007|page=168|isbn=978-1-84520-419-8}}</ref> After the escape, the SS Chief, [[Heinrich Himmler]], ordered the death camp closed. It was dismantled, bulldozed under the earth and planted over with trees to cover it up.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/history-and-overview-of-sobibor|title = History & Overview of Sobibor}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe film begins with a new trainload of Polish Jews arriving for processing at [[Sobibor]]. The German Commandant gives them a welcome speech, assuring the new arrivals that the place is a [[Concentration camp|work camp]]. Other [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officers move along the assembled lines of prisoners, selecting a small number who have trade skills (such as goldsmiths, seamstresses, shoemakers, and tailors). The remaining prisoners are sent away to a different part of the camp from which a pillar of smoke rises day and night. It is some time before the new prisoners realise that Sobibor is a [[death camp]]; all of the other Jews are exterminated in [[gas chamber]]s, and their corpses are cremated in large ovens. The small number of prisoners kept alive in the other part of the camp are charged with sorting the belongings taken from those who are murdered and then repairing the shoes, recycling the clothing, and melting down any silver or gold to make jewellery for the SS officers. Despite their usefulness, these surviving prisoners' existence is precarious; beatings and murders can occur at any time.\n\n[[Gustav Wagner (SS officer)|Gustav Wagner]] is the most clever and sadistic of the German officers. When two prisoners escape from a work detail in the nearby forest, Wagner forces the remaining thirteen prisoners of the work gang to each select one other prisoner to die with them (under the threat that if they refuse, he will select fifty) and then executes all twenty six.\n\nThe leader of the prisoners, [[Leon Feldhendler]], realises that when the trains eventually stop coming, the camp will have outlived its usefulness, and all the remaining Jews will be murdered. He devises a plan for every prisoner to escape, by luring the SS officers and NCOs into the prisoners' barracks and work huts one by one and killing them as quietly as possible. Once all the Germans are dead, the prisoners will assemble into columns and simply march out of the camp as if they have been ordered to, and it is hoped that the Ukrainian Guards, not knowing what is going on, and with no Germans left alive to give orders or raise the alarm, will not interfere. A new group of prisoners arrives: Red Army prisoners who are Russian Jews. Their leader, [[Alexander Pechersky|Sasha Pechersky]] and his men willingly join the revolt, their military skills proving invaluable.\n\nThe Camp Kommandant leaves for several days, taking Wagner with him, which proves an advantage as the most sadistic of the SS officers will be absent. On 14 October 1943, the plan goes into action. One by one, SS officers and NCOs are lured into traps set by groups of prisoners armed with knives and clubs. Eleven Germans are killed, but one officer, [[Karl Frenzel]], unwittingly evades his killers, discovers the corpse of one of his colleagues, and raises the alarm. By now, the prisoners have assembled on the parade ground and, realising the plan has been discovered, Pechersky and Feldhendler urge the prisoners to revolt and flee the camp. Most of the 600 prisoners run for the perimeter fences, some of the Jews using captured rifles to shoot their way through the Ukrainian guards. Other guards open fire with machine guns from observation towers, cutting many of the fleeing prisoners down, and other escapees are killed on the minefield surrounding the camp, over 300 Jews reach the forest and escape.\n\nAs the survivors flee deeper into the forest, famed newscaster [[Howard K. Smith]] narrates the fates that befell some of the survivors on whose accounts the film was based. Of the 300 prisoners who escaped, only approximately 50 survived to see the end of the war in 1945. Pechersky makes it back to Soviet lines and rejoins the [[Red Army]], surviving the war, and Feldhendler lives to see the end of the war but is killed shortly afterwards in a clash with anti-semitic Poles. Sergeant Wagner escapes to Brazil, where he is found stabbed to death in 1980. After the uprising, which was the largest escape from a prison camp of any kind in Europe during World War II, Sobibor was bulldozed to the ground, and trees were planted on the site to remove any sign of its existence.\n\n==Cast==\nIn credits order:\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as [[Leon Feldhendler]]\n* [[Joanna Pacuła]] as Luka ([[Gertrude Poppert-Schonborn]])\n* [[Rutger Hauer]] as [[Alexander Pechersky|Lieutenant Aleksandr 'Sasha' Pechersky]]\n* [[Hartmut Becker]] as [[Gustav Wagner (SS officer)|SS-Hauptscharführer Gustav Wagner]]\n* [[Jack Shepherd (actor)|Jack Shepherd]] as Itzhak Lichtman\n* [[Emil Wolk]] as Samuel Freiberg\n* [[Simon Gregor]] as  [[Stanisław Szmajzner|Stanisław 'Shlomo' Szmajzner]]\n* [[Linal Haft]] as [[Kapo (concentration camp)|Kapo]] Porchek\n* [[Jason Norman (primary topic)|Jason Norman]] as [[Thomas Blatt|Thomas 'Toivi' Blatt]]\n* [[Robert Gwilym]] as Chaim Engel\n* [[Eli Nathenson]] as Moses Szmajzner\n* [[Kurt Raab]] as [[Karl Frenzel|SS-Oberscharführer Karl Frenzel]]\n* [[Eric Caspar]] as [[Franz Reichleitner|SS-Hauptsturmführer Franz Reichleitner]]\n* [[Hugo Bower]] as [[Rudolf Beckmann|SS-Oberscharführer Rudolf Beckmann]]\n* [[Klaus Grünberg]] as [[Erich Bauer|SS-Oberscharführer Erich Bauer]]\n* [[Wolfgang Bathke]] as SS-Unterscharführer Hurst\n* [[Henning Gissel]] as SS-Scharführer Josef Fallaster\n* Henry Stolow as [[Johann Niemann|SS-Untersturmführer Johann Niemann]]\n* [[Ullrich Haupt, Jr.|Ullrich Haupt]] as SS-Scharführer Josef Wolf\n* [[Patti Love]] as Eda Fiszer Lichtman\n* [[Judith Sharp]] as Bajle Sobol\n* {{Interlanguage link|Ellis van Maarseveen|nl}} as [[Selma Engel-Wijnberg|Selma Wijnberg]]\n* [[David Miller (actor)|David Miller]] as Tailor Mundek\n* [[Jack Chissick]] as Hershel Zuckerman\n* [[Ned Vukovic]] as Morris\n* [[Sara Sugarman]] as Naomi\n* [[Peter Jonfield]] as Kapo Sturm\n* [[Dijana Kržanić]] as Esther Terner\n* [[Irfan Mensur]] as Kalimali\n* [[Zoran Stojiljković]] as Boris\n* [[Svetolik Nikačević]] as Old Man\n* [[Miša Janketić]] as Oberkapo Berliner\n* [[Dejan Čavić]] as Kapo Spitz\n* [[Zlatan Fazlagić]] as Weiss\n* [[Predrag Milinković]] as Kapo Jacob\n* [[Svetislav Goncić]] as Gardener\n* [[Gojko Baletić]] as Guard (uncredited)\n* [[Milan Erak]] as SS Corporal (uncredited)\n* [[Rastislav Jović]] as Shlomo's Father (uncredited)\n* [[Erol Kadić]] as Gardener\n* [[Miroljub Lešo]] as Prisoner (uncredited)\n* [[Božidar Pavićević|Bozidar Pavićević-Longa]] as [[Sturmmann|SS-Sturmmann]] [[Ivan Klatt]] (uncredited)\n* [[Howard K.

    "text": "Escape from Sobibor is a 1987 British television film which aired on ITV and CBS. It is the story of the mass escape from the Nazi extermination camp at Sobibor, the most successful uprising by Jewish prisoners of German extermination camps (uprisings also took place at Auschwitz-Birkenau and Treblinka). The film was directed by Jack Gold and shot in Avala, Yugoslavia (now Serbia). The full 176-minute version shown in the UK on 10 May 1987 was pre-empted by a 143-minute version shown in the United States on 12 April 1987. The script, by Reginald Rose, was based on Richard Rashke's 1983 book of the same name, along with a manuscript by Thomas Blatt, \"From the Ashes of Sobibor\", and a book by Stanisław Szmajzner, Inferno in Sobibor. Alan Arkin, Joanna Pacuła, and Rutger Hauer were the primary stars of the film. The film received a Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film and Hauer received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role—Television Film or Miniseries. Esther Raab was a camp survivor who had assisted Rashke with his book and served as a technical consultant. On 14 October 1943, members of the Sobibor camp's underground resistance killed 11 German SS-Totenkopfverbände officers and a number of Sonderdienst Ukrainian and Volksdeutsche guards. Of the 600 inmates in the camp, roughly 300 escaped, although all but 50–70 were later re-captured and killed. After the escape, the SS Chief, Heinrich Himmler, ordered the death camp closed. It was dismantled, bulldozed under the earth and planted over with trees to cover it up. The film begins with a new trainload of Polish Jews arriving for processing at Sobibor. The German Commandant gives them a welcome speech, assuring the new arrivals that the place is a work camp. Other SS officers move along the assembled lines of prisoners, selecting a small number who have trade skills (such as goldsmiths, seamstresses, shoemakers, and tailors). The remaining prisoners are sent away to a different part of the camp from which a pillar of smoke rises day and night. It is some time before the new prisoners realise that Sobibor is a death camp; all of the other Jews are exterminated in gas chambers, and their corpses are cremated in large ovens. The small number of prisoners kept alive in the other part of the camp are charged with sorting the belongings taken from those who are murdered and then repairing the shoes, recycling the clothing, and melting down any silver or gold to make jewellery for the SS officers. Despite their usefulness, these surviving prisoners' existence is precarious; beatings and murders can occur at any time. Gustav Wagner is the most clever and sadistic of the German officers. When two prisoners escape from a work detail in the nearby forest, Wagner forces the remaining thirteen prisoners of the work gang to each select one other prisoner to die with them (under the threat that if they refuse, he will select fifty) and then executes all twenty six. The leader of the prisoners, Leon Feldhendler, realises that when the trains eventually stop coming, the camp will have outlived its usefulness, and all the remaining Jews will be murdered. He devises a plan for every prisoner to escape, by luring the SS officers and NCOs into the prisoners' barracks and work huts one by one and killing them as quietly as possible. Once all the Germans are dead, the prisoners will assemble into columns and simply march out of the camp as if they have been ordered to, and it is hoped that the Ukrainian Guards, not knowing what is going on, and with no Germans left alive to give orders or raise the alarm, will not interfere. A new group of prisoners arrives: Red Army prisoners who are Russian Jews. Their leader, Sasha Pechersky and his men willingly join the revolt, their military skills proving invaluable. The Camp Kommandant leaves for several days, taking Wagner with him, which proves an advantage as the most sadistic of the SS officers will be absent. On 14 October 1943, the plan goes into action. One by one, SS officers and NCOs are lured into traps set by groups of prisoners armed with knives and clubs. Eleven Germans are killed, but one officer, Karl Frenzel, unwittingly evades his killers, discovers the corpse of one of his colleagues, and raises the alarm. By now, the prisoners have assembled on the parade ground and, realising the plan has been discovered, Pechersky and Feldhendler urge the prisoners to revolt and flee the camp. Most of the 600 prisoners run for the perimeter fences, some of the Jews using captured rifles to shoot their way through the Ukrainian guards. Other guards open fire with machine guns from observation towers, cutting many of the fleeing prisoners down, and other escapees are killed on the minefield surrounding the camp, over 300 Jews reach the forest and escape. As the survivors flee deeper into the forest, famed newscaster Howard K. Smith narrates the fates that befell some of the survivors on whose accounts the film was based. Of the 300 prisoners who escaped, only approximately 50 survived to see the end of the war in 1945. Pechersky makes it back to Soviet lines and rejoins the Red Army, surviving the war, and Feldhendler lives to see the end of the war but is killed shortly afterwards in a clash with anti-semitic Poles. Sergeant Wagner escapes to Brazil, where he is found stabbed to death in 1980. After the uprising, which was the largest escape from a prison camp of any kind in Europe during World War II, Sobibor was bulldozed to the ground, and trees were planted on the site to remove any sign of its existence.

The Larsons move to Australia, after Michael is hired by wealthy industrialist Baron Trent to help perfect man-to-dolphin communications. To this end, Michael begins working with two [[dolphins]] named Slim and Delbert.<ref name= \"Directory\">Brooks, Tim and Marsh, Earle ''The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946-Present'', page 272, Ballantine Books, 1999</ref>\n\nMichael's wife died in an automobile accident roughly a year ago. David does his best to fit in with the Aussie lifestyle, and at his new school, but finds it tricky. Katie, who was in the car with her mother during the fatal crash, was not injured physically but has been an elective mute (capable of speaking but refusing) ever since. Initially, Katie distrusts her new therapist, Alison Mitchell. Although Katie is not comfortable around most people, she promptly hits it off with Slim and Delbert. Moreover, Katie soon discovers that she has a telepathic means of communicating with both dolphins; thus she succeeds where her father and Trent have failed.<ref name= \"Directory\"/>\n\nAlso working for Trent is Didge, an Aboriginal Australian.<ref>O'Connor, John J., ''Review/Television; Dolphins, Australia and Family Problems'', The New York Times, January 21, 1989</ref> Didge acts as Michael's assistant, besides being a mentor and (when called for) bodyguard to David and Katie.\n\nKevin Mitchell, Alison's son, is one of David's classmates and frequently coaches David through life at their school.\n\nThe series, filmed on location at Seaworld on Australia's Gold Coast, was co-created by [[Peter Benchley]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Frank Converse]] as Michael Larson\n* Trey Ames as David Larson\n* [[Karron Graves]] as Katie Larson\n* [[Ernie Dingo]] as Didge\n* [[Virginia Hey]] as Alison Mitchell\n* Antony Richards as Kevin Mitchell\n* [[Nick Tate]] as Baron Trent\n* [[Noah Taylor]] as Convict\n*[[Penne Hackforth-Jones]]\n* [[Richard Moir]]\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |background= |overall= |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |viewers= |country=U.S. |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |Title = Pilot\n |DirectedBy = [[Mel Damski]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Peter Benchley]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1989|1|21}}\n |Viewers=17.1<ref>{{cite news |date=January 25, 1989 |title=NBC scores super ratings |department=Life |work=[[USA Today]] |page=3D |id={{ProQuest|306147740}}}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = Seeking to start a new life after the death of his wife dolphin researcher Michael Larson moves to Australia with his two children, and is hired by Baron Trent to figure out dolphin communication.

It is also known as Angels' Brigade and Seven from Heaven. The film has major roles for Peter Lawford and Jack Palance as the leaders of a drug cartel, and gives minor roles to character actors Jim Backus, Alan Hale, Jr., Pat Buttram and Arthur Godfrey (playing himself). Of the actresses who played the film's seven female protagonists, however, the closest any had previously come to any degree of fame was Susan Kiger, who had been the Playboy Playmate of the Month for January 1977. Kiger played singer Michelle Wilson; her co-stars were Sylvia Anderson as stuntwoman Terry Grant, Lieu Chinh as martial arts instructor Keiko Umaro, Jacqueline Cole as high-school teacher April, Noela Velasco as model Maria, and Robin Greer as policewoman Elaine Brenner. Her younger sister Liza Greer plays high-school student Trish, who invites herself into the team. Jack Palance played chief antagonist Mike Farrell, assistant to Lawford's kingpin character. The film's plot focuses on seven female vigilantes who decide to undermine the operation of a drug cartel. The \"revenge\" mentioned in the title reflects that one of the vigilantes is primarily motivated by her desire to avenge her hospitalized brother, a drug user.",
