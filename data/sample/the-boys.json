  "opening_text": "The Boys is an American satirical superhero television series, developed by showrunner Eric Kripke for Amazon Prime Video, that premiered on July 26, 2019. Based on the comic book of the same name by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, it follows the eponymous team of vigilantes as they attempt to take down The Seven, a team of superpowered individuals who abuse their powers. Originally intended to be a feature-length film trilogy, the comic book series adaptation began its development in 2008 with Adam McKay set to direct, until a series of creative differences led to the project's cancellation until it was revived in 2016 as a television series. The series premiered on July 26, 2019, on Amazon Prime Video. Kripke also serves as an executive producer, alongside Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. Filming for the series takes place in Canada despite the storyline primarily taking place in New York City. With the exception of the first season, which released every episode on the same day, episodes are released on a weekly basis with each season premiering its first three episodes for the remainder of the series. As of July 18, 2024, thirty-two episodes have aired throughout the course of four seasons. The series is currently set to conclude with a fifth and final season, announced on June 11, 2024, and currently in development. A companion short film, Butcher: A Short Film, was released on September 10, 2020.",

  "text": "The Boys is an American satirical superhero television series, developed by showrunner Eric Kripke for Amazon Prime Video, that premiered on July 26, 2019. Based on the comic book of the same name by Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson, it follows the eponymous team of vigilantes as they attempt to take down The Seven, a team of superpowered individuals who abuse their powers. Originally intended to be a feature-length film trilogy, the comic book series adaptation began its development in 2008 with Adam McKay set to direct, until a series of creative differences led to the project's cancellation until it was revived in 2016 as a television series. The series premiered on July 26, 2019, on Amazon Prime Video. Kripke also serves as an executive producer, alongside Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. Filming for the series takes place in Canada despite the storyline primarily taking place in New York City. With the exception of the first season, which released every episode on the same day, episodes are released on a weekly basis with each season premiering its first three episodes for the remainder of the series. As of July 18, 2024, thirty-two episodes have aired throughout the course of four seasons. The series is currently set to conclude with a fifth and final season, announced on June 11, 2024, and currently in development. A companion short film, Butcher: A Short Film, was released on September 10, 2020. Seven on 7 is a faux current affairs digital series serving as the center of several viral marketing campaigns for The Boys and its spin-off series Gen V. As of September 28, 2022, a total of nine \"minisodes\" have been released. A companion short film, set between the first and second seasons of The Boys, was uploaded on Twitter on September 10, 2020, alongside the release of the series episode \"Nothing Like It in the World\", with Karl Urban reprising his role as Billy Butcher. The episode was retitled from \"Assassination Run\" to \"Season Four Finale\" due to the attempted assassination of Donald Trump.
