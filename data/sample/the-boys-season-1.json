The season was produced by [[Sony Pictures Television]] in association with [[Point Grey Pictures]], [[Original Film]], Kripke Enterprises, Kickstart Entertainment and KFL Nightsky Productions.\n\nThe show's first season stars [[Karl Urban]], [[Jack Quaid]], [[Antony Starr]], [[Erin Moriarty (actress)|Erin Moriarty]], [[Dominique McElligott]], [[Jessie T. Usher]], [[Laz Alonso]], [[Chace Crawford]], [[Tomer Kapon]], [[Karen Fukuhara]], [[Nathan Mitchell]], and [[Elisabeth Shue]]. The story takes place in a universe where most of the superpowered individuals are recognized as [[superhero]]es, but in reality abuse their powers for personal gain, information the public is kept unaware of. The series follows the eponymous Boys, led by [[Billy Butcher]] (Urban), a group of vigilantes looking to bring down Vought International and expose its corrupt superheroes. When his girlfriend is accidentally killed by [[List of The Boys characters#A-Train|A-Train]] (Usher), [[Hughie Campbell]] (Quaid) joins the Boys to get revenge against the Seven. Meanwhile, [[Starlight (character)|Annie January]] (Moriarty) is forced to face the truth about those she admires, after she joins the Seven, led by [[Homelander]] (Starr). The Boys attempt to stop Vought from receiving government support for superheroes by uncovering the company's secrets. When Hughie and Annie begin a romantic relationship, the conflict is muddled despite the two of them initially being unaware of each other's affiliations.\n\nThe season premiered on the streaming service [[Amazon Prime Video]] on July 26, 2019, with all the eight episodes being released in a single day. It became the most watched series released by Prime Video at the time of its release, having managed to attract a wide audience that led to a high viewership. The season received largely positive reviews from critics and audiences, with high praise towards its social commentary, story, black humor, faithfulness to the source material, visual style, screenplay, and performances (particularly Urban, Quaid, and Starr). The series was renewed for a [[The Boys season 2|second season]] on July 19, 2019.<ref name=\":18\">{{Cite web|last=Petski|first=Denise|date=July 19, 2019|title='The Boys' Renewed For Season 2 By Amazon; Aya Cash Closes Deal As Stormfront|url=https://deadline.com/2019/07/the-boys-renewed-season-2-amazon-aya-cash-closes-deal-stormfront-1202649409/|access-date=June 13, 2021|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|archive-date=July 19, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190719235155/https://deadline.com/2019/07/the-boys-renewed-season-2-amazon-aya-cash-closes-deal-stormfront-1202649409/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#380000 |overall=5 |season=5 |title=32 |director=13 |writer=27 |airdate=18 |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Boys season 1\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n| Title           = [[The Name of the Game (The Boys episode)|The Name of the Game]]\n| DirectedBy      = [[Dan Trachtenberg]]\n| WrittenBy       = [[Eric Kripke]]\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|7|26}}\n| ShortSummary    = {{For|the original comic books|The Name of the Game (comic book){{!}}The Name of the Game (2006 comic book)|The Bloody Doors Off#The Name of the Game{{!}}The Name of the Game (2012 comic book)}}[[Hughie Campbell|Hugh \"Hughie\" Campbell]] suffers [[posttraumatic stress disorder|mental trauma]] after his girlfriend Robin is accidentally killed by celebrity superhero A-Train.

In Central Park, Annie meets Hughie by happenstance, motivating each other to stand up for themselves and face their challenges. Hughie plants the bug, but Translucent discovers it and confronts him.

Stillwell tells Homelander about evidence the Deep found incriminating him for the plane crash, so she handles it while he talks to Deep. While working with the Deep, Annie promises to kill him if he tries to sexually assault her again. Stillwell uses shapeshifting Supe Doppelgänger to blackmail Senator Calhoun into allowing a vote that could enable Vought to contract superheroes to the military. Annie stops an attempted rape, unaware she is being recorded. Her agent, Ashley Barrett, reprimands her for potentially causing negative exposure and legal implications. While Homelander searches for Translucent, Frenchie places [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]] explosives in Translucent's colon, who fearfully confesses A-Train was with his girlfriend Popclaw before he killed Robin. The Boys learn Homelander is nearby, so they cannot risk killing Translucent with the C-4.

Beforehand, Hughie meets Annie and invites her to lunch, where they open up to each other. Meanwhile, A-Train secretly uses Compound V to win and publicly announces he is single, breaking his promise to Popclaw to announce their relationship.

With their Compound V supply compromised, A-Train has Popclaw go into hiding while he searches for the Female. Stillwell sends Homelander and Queen Maeve to save a hijacked airliner. After Homelander accidentally destroys the control panel, he abandons the plane and its passengers, forcing Maeve to leave with him before she can rescue them. After the Female kills a woman associated with her captors, Frenchie tracks her to [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] and makes a momentary connection with her before losing her in the crowd just as A-Train arrives and tries to kill her.
